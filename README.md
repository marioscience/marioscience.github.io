Resume and portfolio.

Please visit my [portfolio and resume](https://mariomatos.dev/)

There is a resume.json file with the specification file for my resume. This uses the standard for json resumes found at https://jsonresume.org/

### Generate resume files

To generate a resume using a different theme, make sure to clone the theme github in the project's root directory and run "resume export index.html --format html --theme <theme-name>". This requires resume-cli to be installed, install dependencies as needed. 
An index.html will be created which, at the moment, I am hosting using github pages. This requires the index.html to be pushed to the repository named marioscience.github.io under my github account.

### Hosting

At the moment https://mariomatos.dev/ is a domain name that directly redirects to https://marioscience.github.io/.
